I started this assignment way to late on and have very little done. I started to create an object class
and some other stuff that I've seen in other solutions to this problem. I'm going to continue working 
throughout tonight and hopefully have it done by early morning to officially turn in. Just turning this
in incase the submission closes earlier than it normally does.
