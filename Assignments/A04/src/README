Usage: 
    ./dungeon
    ./dungeon --nummon <integer>

./dungeon
    - will spawn a dungeon with the PC at a random location and he'll drunkenly move around
./dungeon --nummon <integer>
    - will create monsters equal to the integer provided.
    - There will only be 1 Non tunnelling mob/room if integer > number of rooms
    - Non-Tunnelling monsters will run around randomly until they run into the PC
    - When the PC is hit by a monster, he'll die and you'll get a GAME OVER screen.

The professor said we will only be graded on tunnelling and nontunnelling monsters so I omitted
attributes for sake of time. For this first submission, I cannot get Tmonsters to work correctly
however, NTmonsters work just fine. So i'm spawning Tmonsters but they don't move.
