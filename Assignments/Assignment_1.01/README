So I currently have the 80x21 board with 5 random sized rooms in random locations working.
My problem is that my collision detection for rooms doesn't always work and sometimes it takes
a LONG time (potentially forever) to generate a dungeon. In the case of it taking more than a 
few seconds, just close the process and re-run.

Sometimes when creating a dungeon it places a room inside another room which i havent figured out yet.
Also sometimes it creates "rooms" that are 1xN that I also haven't figured out.

I do not have the hallways in place, I'll have some pseudocode but didn't give myself enough
time to work it out in C. My bad. 

I experimented with structs which proved to be extremely helpful and I created an array of 5 structs
which held a bunch of different data for the rooms that I found useful.
