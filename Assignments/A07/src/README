Usage: ./rlg327 <monster_description.txt>

I created a parser.cpp which is an independent program from the rlg327 project.
I created a monster class which holds all of the appropriate values the monster
needs. I then itterate through the given file and store the desired values in
my monster class then I put the monster information into a vector<monster> 
monster_list that I created. Once all of the monsters have been read in the 
program prints the monsters to the screen and exits.
