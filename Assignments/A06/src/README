 I ported everything from C to C++ and turned Character into a Class. I also
 turned NPC and PC into classes that inherit from Character. My biggest issue
 with porting was correcting the errors but I was able to fix the errors within
 a couple of hours.

 I implemented a teleportation function so that when the player pressed 'g'
 they were put into teleportation mode until they pressed 'g' again which 
 exits normally or press 'r' which places them in a random position in the 
 dungeon then exits. 

 I am having trouble getting PC Fog of War working correctly. I need a bit more
 time and assume the TA's wont close the submission until 11AM tomorrow.
 However, I'm turning this solution in right now just to play it safe. 
 Hopefully, I am able to turn in another copy later tonight or early tomorrow
 morning with a correctly implemented Fog of War.
